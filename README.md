## 🧠 Mushroom Image Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying mushroom species based on images using traditional machine learning techniques. It does **not** rely on deep learning, making it lightweight and suitable for environments with limited computational resources.

### 🔍 Project Goals

* Extract visual features (HOG, ORB, SIFT) from mushroom images.
* Train ML models (SVM, Random Forest, etc.) to classify mushrooms into different species.
* Evaluate model performance and analyze which feature-method and algorithm combination works best.

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes labeled images of mushrooms belonging to various species. All images were resized and preprocessed while maintaining the visual integrity of each mushroom.

### ⚙️ Techniques Used

* Feature extraction: HOG, ORB, SIFT,...
* Machine learning models: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,...
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

### 👥 Authors
